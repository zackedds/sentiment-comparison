        "source": "Automotive Reality Check",
        "stance": "con",
        "content": "Electric vehicles face serious challenges that proponents often ignore. The environmental cost of battery production is devastating, requiring rare earth mining that damages ecosystems. Charging infrastructure remains inadequate in most areas, causing range anxiety and inconvenience. Grid capacity struggles to support widespread EV adoption. Battery degradation reduces vehicle value and creates disposal problems. High purchase prices exclude most consumers despite subsidies. Cold weather performance is poor. The electricity powering EVs often comes from fossil fuels anyway. These significant drawbacks make EVs impractical for many drivers."
