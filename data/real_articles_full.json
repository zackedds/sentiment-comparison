          "content": "Are entry-level jobs on the way out? For decades, entry-level roles have provided essential training grounds for newcomers to step into the world of work. From finance to journalism, junior staff have traditionally handled the ‘grunt work’ as a rite of passage as much as a development opportunity. But as AI reshapes the career ladder, these early entry points could be increasingly at risk, according to Bloomberg. International Workers Day, on 1 May, signifies the labour movement’s struggle for the rights of workers. AI stands as one of the most significant challenges – and opportunities – facing the labour market today. While 170 million new jobs are projected to be created this decade, the rise of AI-powered tools threatens to automate as many roles as it creates, particularly for white collar, entry-level roles. Bloomberg finds that AI could replace more than 50% of the tasks performed by market research analysts (53%) and sales representatives (67%), compared to just 9% and 21% for their managerial counterparts. Whether by narrowing entry pathways or making roles that once required specialized skills more accessible, estimates suggest that AI could impact nearly 50 million US jobs in the coming years. How AI could be closing the door on talent... The Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 reveals that 40% of employers expect to reduce their workforce where AI can automate tasks. Technology, overall, is projected to be the most disruptive force in the labour market, with trends in AI and information processing technology expected to create 11 million jobs, while simultaneously displacing 9 million others. As entry-level roles decline, salary expectations are also shifting, with remaining hires expected to take on roles supported by AI for less money. A recent survey found that 49% of US Gen Z job hunters believe AI has reduced the value of their college education in the job market. At the same time, US firms are expanding business operations in India, where skilled professionals can be employed at significantly lower costs, Charter points out, further intensifying competition for white-collar roles. But this can create a talent pipeline problem, with significant implications for social mobility and equal representation, Bloomberg says. ...while also opening new doors Gen AI could democratize access to jobs, making it easier to build the technical knowledge and skills that have historically excluded otherwise qualified workers, according to Charter. Rather than eliminating entry-level opportunities altogether, companies could harness AI to train the next generation of senior professionals. From law firms saying goodbye to the billable hour to more emphasis on apprenticeships, traditional structures could be redefined. As Gen AI becomes further embedded in the workplace, companies will need to invest in substantial upskilling efforts to prepare their employees for the AI-driven economy. Alongside global macroeconomic trends, AI is set to reshape the traditional career ladder, with entry-level jobs at risk. But employers and employees alike can prioritize upskilling, education efforts and levelling the playing field that comes with harnessing AI’s potential."

          "title": "Incorporating AI impacts in BLS employment projections: occupational case studies",
          "source": "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics — Monthly Labor Review (Feb 2025)",
          "stance": "neutral",
          "url": "",
          "content": "In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly, finding growing applications across industries and occupations. This development has generated interest in how the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics assesses and incorporates AI’s potential labor market impacts in its employment projections. In this article, we explain the Bureau’s approach to this type of projections work, illustrating it with several occupational case studies based on research done for the 2023–33 projections cycle. The case studies focus on selected occupations in the computer, legal, business and financial, and architecture and engineering occupational groups. Discussions about advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have become commonplace. In recent years, such advances have received constant news coverage, especially since the deployment of Open AI’s ChatGPT in November 2022.[1] ChatGPT, a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology that allows users to have humanlike conversations, was the first to offer many users the opportunity to directly experience the potential power of AI in their lives. Millions of Americans have since used ChatGPT.[2] Although AI and chatbots are not new, ChatGPT and similar tools have opened a new portal into the world of large language models (LLMs) and their wide-ranging applications.[3] Generative AI (GenAI) tools are becoming increasingly powerful in creating prose, images, videos, and sound. Because of the sheer potential of these tools, many people have been asking how they might affect our future, including that of workers and employment. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment Projections (EP) program approaches AI in the same way as it does other technologies.[4] Established technologies and other structural changes to the labor market have impacts that register in the historical data.[5] BLS projection methods are designed to measure and reflect structural technological changes, and these changes and their employment impacts tend to occur gradually.[6] There have been many claims about new technologies displacing jobs, and although such displacement has occurred in the past, it tends to take longer than technologists typically expect. Various technologies have had occupational impacts throughout recent history, but many affected occupations have still seen employment growth. Although it is always possible that future developments will deviate from historical patterns, BLS projection methods are not designed to capture extremely rapid technological change and, therefore, assume that the overall pace of technological change will be consistent with past experience. Projecting future employment involves substantial uncertainty, especially in the case of evaluating the future impacts of a developing technology. BLS acknowledges this uncertainty in analyzing the relative likelihood of employment impacts across occupations. In this article, we use case studies to illustrate how BLS considers various factors of uncertainty in its employment projections. The next section provides more details, along with illustrative examples, on how BLS has approached this type of projections work in the past. The section after that presents several case studies, based on EP research done for the 2023–33 projections cycle, examining the potential employment impacts of AI technological advancements on selected occupations in the computer, legal, business and financial, and architecture and engineering occupational groups. The final section concludes, summarizing our results and noting EP’s plans for future research. Background and research considerations. EP research connects the potential employment impacts of a new technology with data trends. The goal of this approach is to determine whether these impacts are likely to continue as the new technology grows in adoption and maturation or whether they are likely to diminish as the benefits of the technology are fully realized. For an emerging technology that is not yet reflected in historical data, EP aims to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion about the direction and magnitude of the technology’s future impact on the labor market. One illustrative example of how this research has affected BLS projections involves photographic process workers. To show a decline in labor demand for this occupation in the early 2000s, when digital cameras were on the verge of displacing most film cameras, EP adjusted its models accordingly. Digital cameras improved on an already-existing technology, and the path to integrating them into business operations and consumer lives was clear. Digital cameras were already replacing film cameras, and the employment impacts of this shift were directly implied by the speed and maturation of technological change. Despite the absence of historical data showing employment declines for photographic process workers, EP projected that employment in the occupation would decline 23.6 percent from 2004 to 2014. Indeed, employment in the occupation started to fall precipitously in the early 2000s, declining from a peak of 86,300 in 2004 to 28,800 in 2014, with a further decline to only 9,200 in 2023.[7] The potential for AI, particularly GenAI, to disrupt future employment has been a prominent topic in recent economic commentary. BLS employment projections consider and reflect the productivity-enhancing effects of automation and a wide range of technologies, including AI, on occupations and industries. Over the 2023–33 projections period, AI is expected to primarily affect occupations whose core tasks can be most easily replicated by GenAI in its current form. These occupations include medical transcriptionists and customer service representatives, whose employment is projected to decline by 4.7 and 5.0 percent, respectively, through 2033.[49] Other occupations also may see AI impacts, although not to the same extent. For instance, computer occupations may see productivity impacts from AI, but the need to implement and maintain AI infrastructure could in actuality boost demand for some occupations in this group. Among legal occupations, paralegals and legal assistants are likely to experience lower employment demand because of LLM adoption, while lawyers are expected to be less affected. Within business and financial operations occupations, insurance adjusters and appraisers are expected to see reduced employment demand, with AI being able to quickly produce monetary estimates of property damage. Meanwhile, other occupations in this group, such as personal financial advisors, will likely continue to see strong employment growth because demand for human counsel in complex financial matters will persist, particularly for older clients. Architecture and engineering occupations may see some productivity gains from GenAI, but these gains will likely be in line with those afforded by software and other technological advancements in prior decades. As a result, occupations in this group are not expected to see substantial GenAI-driven reductions in employment demand over the projections period. Each year, BLS issues new 10-year projections that incorporate new data, research, and analysis. EP continually conducts research on new technologies, including AI and LLMs, to better understand their potential employment and economic impacts over the projections period. Besides reflecting these findings in its 10-year projections, the program also evaluates previous projections, explores shifts among skills that are in demand, and considers the potential for technology to create new types of jobs. EP will continue to monitor AI as it evolves, ensuring that BLS projections reflect an updated assessment of the latest developments in this technology and its likely employment impacts."

          "content": "Over the past several months, the Trump administration has implemented key aspects of its economic policies by raising tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners and winning final congressional passage of its sweeping tax and budget bill, officially titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Chart shows Roughly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump administration’s tariff policies The public’s views on these policies remain more negative than positive. A 61% majority of Americans disapprove of the Trump administration increasing tariffs on goods imported from most countries that trade with the United States, while 38% approve. These views are largely unchanged since April, shortly after Trump unveiled his far-reaching tariffs policy. Note: This survey was in the field on Aug. 7, when the Trump administration imposed higher import taxes on scores of countries, including tariffs as high as 50% for some countries.   By a wide margin, Republicans approve of the administration’s tariff and trade policies while Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove: 68% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approve of the increased tariffs. 89% of Democrats and Democratic leaners disapprove. Americans continue to express more negative than positive views of the GOP’s tax and budget legislation, which Trump signed into law on July 4. Only about a third (32%) approve of the legislation, while 46% disapprove. And by wide margins, more say the long-term effects of the legislation will be negative rather than positive. View of Trump’s handling of the economy also remain negative. A 55% majority say they are not too confident or not at all confident in Trump’s ability to make good decisions on economic policy, which is virtually unchanged from April. How will the Trump administration’s tariff policies impact the country and Americans personally? Majorities of Americans say the long-term effects of the administration’s tariff policies will be mostly negative for the country (55%) and for themselves and their families (also 55%). Chart shows Majorities of Americans say Trump’s tariff policies will have mostly negative effects in the long run While there are partisan differences in these views, Republicans express mixed views of the impacts of the tariffs, while Democrats are largely negative.  The country as a whole More than twice as many Americans say the tariffs will have mostly negative effects on the country in coming years (55%) as say the effects will be mostly positive (26%). About one-in-five (19%) expect the effects will be about equally positive and negative. About half of Republicans and GOP leaners (52%) anticipate that the tariffs will benefit the country in the long term, while 27% see mixed positive and negative effects; 21% expect the tariffs to negatively affect the country in coming years. By comparison, nearly nine-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (87%) say the tariffs will have negative effects on the country in coming years.     Americans and their families When asked about the effect of such policies on them and their families, overall views are similar: 55% of adults say they expect the personal impact to be mostly negative in coming years, while 21% say it will be mostly positive. Roughly a quarter say the effect will be about equally positive and negative. Notably, Republicans are less likely to say the tariffs will have mostly positive effects on themselves and their families (40%) than on the country (52%) in the coming years. They are somewhat more likely to say the personal impact will be mixed (35%, compared with 27% who say this about the country). Democrats, by contrast, are nearly as skeptical of the long-term personal impact of the tariffs (84% say it will be mostly negative) as they are of their effect on the country (87%). More Americans disapprove than approve of GOP’s tax and budget law Just over a month since being passed into law, the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” continues to be viewed more negatively than positively: 46% of Americans disapprove of the law, while 32% approve. Another 23% are not sure. Chart shows About a third of Americans approve of GOP’s tax and budget bill, while nearly half disapprove These views have changed little since June, prior to the passing of the bill by the Senate, when 49% of adults said they opposed the budget and tax bill proposed by Trump and Republicans in Congress and 29% favored it. There continue to be wide partisan differences in views of the legislation: Six-in-ten Republicans say they approve of the budget and tax law, while 17% disapprove and 23% are not sure. Democrats disapprove of the law by an overwhelming margin (75% to 6%), with 18% not sure. Democratic opposition to the law is far more intense than Republican support for it. While 61% of Democrats strongly disapprove of the measure, just 21% of Republicans strongly approve. Overall, far more Americans say the tax and budget law will have mostly negative effects than mostly positive effects. Chart shows About half of Republicans see long-term benefits from the GOP’s tax and budget bill; far more Democrats say it will have negative impacts Nearly half (47%) say the law will have a mostly negative effect on the country in coming years, while 25% expect mostly positive effects. About a quarter (26%) say the results will be mixed. Views are fairly similar regarding the law’s personal impact. As with overall opinions about the law, negative opinions about the effects of the law among Democrats far surpass positive views among Republicans. About eight-in-ten Democrats (78%) say the law’s effect on the country over the coming years will be mostly negative. A smaller share of Republicans (48%) say it will have a mostly positive impact. Partisans are similarly divided when it comes to the effect of the budget and tax law on them and their families: Seven-in-ten Democrats say the impact of the law will be mostly negative on them and their families, and 46% of Republicans say it will be mostly positive."

          "content": "For all the “sky-is-falling” cries over President Donald Trump’s tariffs, it looks like his strategy may be working — just as his Aug. 1 deadline nears. In the past week, the Trump folks struck deals with Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines — and may be on the verge of a deal with Europe: On Friday, the prez cited a 50-50 chance of reaching an agreement with the European Union. These developments — on top of previous deals with Vietnam, the United Kingdom and a framework on rare-earth exports and tech restrictions with China — go a long way toward standing up Trump’s vision for the international economy, with better terms for America. And at least so far, no catastrophic fallout. Heck, the nation looks poised to benefit enormously on several fronts. Trump’s deals in Asia, for starters, reopen US access to cheap markets, sidestepping China, our greatest economic and military rival. Indonesia and the Philippines will pay 19% tariffs on their exports to the United States and levy 0% tariffs on more than 99% of US goods. Japan will see 15% tariffs and invest more than half a trillion dollars into the US economy. Washington will also slap fewer restrictions on Indonesian, Filipino and Japanese goods, everything from cars and clothes to electronics and rubber. And now EU officials are signaling their support for a deal that would mirror the one Trump made with Japan — reciprocal tariffs of 15%. Notably, the EU includes 27 countries in a shared common market, representing the largest singular trading bloc for the United States. The EU deal would clearly benefit US consumers looking to buy, say, French wines or German cars, and also US producers seeking wider access to the European markets. Meanwhile, the resolution of trade issues with so many countries will calm markets and bring confidence and stability to the business community. As for the predicted inflation, it’s nowhere to be seen: June’s consumer price index came in at a reasonable 2.7%. Recall it hit 9% under Joe Biden. That’s partially because corporations, unsure of whether high tariffs will remain permanent and nervous about hiking prices, have absorbed most of the tariffs’ costs, at least for now. More good news: The tariffs brought in $64 billion in revenue for the government in just the first three months since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement. He’s suggested issuing “rebates” based on that haul, but far better to use the new revenue to pay down the runaway national debt. Yes, there’s plenty more to do: Team Trump needs to finalize agreements with Canada, India and Mexico, along with the EU, and numerous smaller countries, before the president’s across-the-board reciprocal tariffs hit Aug. 1. So considerable uncertainty remains. But clearly the signs are good, at least so far — despite all the doomy predictions."

          "content": "Traders seem to agree, at least for now. Futures contracts for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 were up 0.55% this morning prior to the opening bell, after the index closed up 0.68% yesterday. The index is up 18% this year, despite worries that the AI boom bears a resemblance to the dotcom bubble of 2000. Hemant Taneja, CEO of VC firm General Catalyst, was quoted in the Financial Times this morning saying: “Of course there’s a bubble … Bubbles are good. Bubbles align capital and talent in a new trend, and that creates some carnage, but it also creates enduring, new businesses that change the world.” The FT’s report hinges on the fact that VC firms have plowed $161 billion into AI startups this year, and 10 of them—OpenAI and Anthropic among them—now have a collective valuation of $1 trillion. But none of them are profitable, the FT says. We should all stop worrying and learn to love the AI boom, if new research from Goldman Sachs is correct. In a note titled “The AI Spending Boom Is Not Too Big,” Joseph Briggs and his colleagues say, “Anticipated investment levels are sustainable, although the ultimate AI winners remain less clear.” The Goldman team argues that when deployed properly, the productivity gains from AI will far exceed the investment currently going into it. “We are not concerned about the total amount of AI investment. AI investment as a share of U.S. GDP is smaller today (<1%) than in prior large technology cycles (2%-5%). Furthermore, we estimate an $8 trillion present-discounted value for the capital revenue unlocked by AI productivity gains in the U.S., with plausible estimates ranging from $5 trillion–$19 trillion,” they said. The money going into AI-related capital expenditures (capex) will grow massively this year and next, according to Samik Chatterjee and his colleagues at JPMorgan. Capex across the AI “hyperscalers” will grow 60% this year and another 30% next year, they say. “On a dollar basis, the growth implies a significant increase of more than +$100 billion of additional data center capex in 2025, the largest annual step-up to date, surpassing the record set in 2024. Importantly, the stronger trajectory is also anticipated to carry into 2026, where growth is now tracking at … more than +$80 billion for next year.” Capex will be in the region of $300 billion this year from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta alone, Goldman estimates. The irrepressible Daniel Ives of Wedbush, perhaps Wall Street’s biggest cheerleader for AI, took a field trip to Asia to see for himself what the demand for Nvidia’s chips is like. “We estimate the demand to supply ratio from enterprises for Nvidia’s next generation GPUs are approaching 10:1, which is a staggering number, which speaks to how early this AI revolution is in its life cycle,” he told clients in a research note. “We have barely scratched the surface of this fourth industrial revolution."

          "content": "Companies announcing multi-billion dollar investments in artificial intelligence have raised concerns about the formation of a bubble reminiscent of the dotcom boom and bust. Investors are on guard for signals that demand is tailing off or that the massive spending is not paying off as anticipated. A BofA Global Research's monthly fund manager survey revealed that 54% of investors said they thought that AI stocks were in a bubble compared with 38% who do not believe that a bubble exists. Here is a list of industry executives, economists and analysts’ takes on the topic: BANK OF ENGLAND Global markets could tumble if investors' mood sours on the prospects for artificial intelligence, the Bank of England said on October 8. The risk of a sharp market correction has increased, the BoE's Financial Policy Committee said in a quarterly update, in its sharpest warning to date of the dangers of an AI-triggered market slump, adding that the risk of spillovers to Britain's financial system from such a shock was material. BRYAN YEO, GIC PRIVATE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER There's a little bit of a hype bubble going on in the early-stage venture space, said Singapore sovereign wealth fund's Yeo during a panel discussion at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025 on October 3. Any company startup with an AI label will be valued right up there at huge multiples of whatever the small revenue (is),... That might be fair for some companies and probably not for others. JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF AMAZON “When people get very excited as they are today about artificial intelligence, for example, every experiment gets funded,... And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas,” Bezos said during the Italian tech week, opens new tab on October 3. “A bubble like a banking bubble, a crisis in the banking system, that's just bad ... The ones that are industrial are not nearly as bad, it could even be good because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, society benefits from those inventions.” JOSEPH BRIGGS, ECONOMIST AT GOLDMAN SACHS' GLOBAL ECONOMICS RESEARCH The flood of multibillion-dollar investments pouring into U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure is sustainable, pushing back on mounting concerns that the sector's spending spree could be overheating, Briggs said in a note on October 16. While the overall macroeconomic case for AI investment remains strong, he cautioned that the ultimate AI winners remain less clear, with fast technological change and low switching costs potentially limiting first-mover advantages. MORTEN WIEROD, ABB CEO I don't think there is a bubble, but we do see do see some constraints in terms of construction capacity not keeping up with all the new investments, Wierod told Reuters on October 16. We are talking about trillions in investment, he said, adding: That will take a few years to implement because there is not enough people and resources to build all this. PIERRE-OLIVIER GOURINCHAS, IMF'S CHIEF ECONOMIST The U.S. artificial intelligence investment boom may be followed by a dot-com-style bust, but it is less likely to be a systemic event that would crater the U.S. or global economy, Gourinchas, said on October 14. This is not financed by debt, and that means that if there is a market correction, some shareholders, some equity holders, may lose out. SAM ALTMAN, OPENAI CEO “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My answer is yes,” Altman told tech media The Verge in August. “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money. We don’t know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money.” UBS Almost as many investors who feel we're in an AI bubble are also hanging on to their investments in the sector, UBS equity strategists said on October 14. Most felt we were in an AI bubble, but that far from the apex of a bubble peak and thus around 90% of the people who said we were in a bubble said they were still invested in many of the AI-related areas."

          "content": "Recent estimates on job losses in California caused by a $20 minimum wage hike for fast-food employees confirm what classical liberal economics has always taught about the minimum wage and what Cato experts said about the law last summer. As Milton Friedman taught, minimum wage laws “increase unemployment” and “the groups that will be hurt the most are the low-paid and the unskilled.” In California, the raise in the minimum wage for fast-food workers from $16 to $20 was signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on September 28, 2023, and went into effect on April 1, 2024. The law applies to restaurants, coffee shops, and juice bars with at least 60 locations nationwide, such as McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Jersey Mike’s, Del Taco, and Pizza Hut. The wage hike increased labor costs and, according to the Employment Policies Institute, killed 6,166 fast-food jobs between September 2023 and June 2024. Edgeworth Economics estimated at least 9,600 job losses—and up to 19,300—in the first full year since the law was signed. The Employment Policies Institute also reported that between September 2023 and June 2024, total private-sector fast-food employment nationwide grew 1.6 percent, while in California it declined 1.1 percent, a steeper drop than statewide private employment, which fell only 0.3 percent in the same period. Citing the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, the EPI argued that the $20 minimum wage “shows crystal-clear negative employment consequences” and “unequivocal job losses.” Economist Stephen G. Bronars, PhD, of Edgeworth Economics, stated that the $20 minimum wage harms California’s least experienced workers by making them more expensive but no more productive, prompting limited-service restaurants to replace employees with kiosks as businesses adapt to higher labor costs. The law functions as a price floor—a government-imposed restriction preventing employers and workers from freely negotiating wages—and, as decades of evidence suggest, such controls risk leaving low-skilled workers worse off, offering only symbolic hope rather than real economic improvement."

          "content": "Around one million workers in the United States earn at or below the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. In recent years—and in light of inaction by the federal government—a rising number of states and localities are acting on their own. As of the end of 2023, 30 states, 48 localities, and Washington, DC have adopted their own minimum wages above the federal rate. Critics of minimum wages highlight the theoretically negative impact of minimum wages on company profits and the tendency to raise prices, which in turn damage the employment prospects and purchasing power of low-wage workers. This argument alleges that wage floors can damage the prospects of low-wage workers even as they aim to help them. A recent paper by Ben Zipperer, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, on minimum wages tries to unravel their exact implications for workers and presents a far rosier, if more nuanced, picture than the critical view above provides. There are three primary avenues through which minimum wages can improve labor market conditions and businesses’ bottom lines, contrary to the arguments against them: reducing the rate at which workers move in and out of jobs; raising prices and wages in a more egalitarian and business-friendly way than critics often admit; and moving workers into better-paid jobs. Key findings Generally, low-wage workers shift in and out of jobs at a higher rate than higher-wage workers. Up to 10 percent of workers gain new jobs or become unemployed every month, and more than 20 percent change their employment statuses in these two ways every three months. This is because when wages are low, workers are more likely to seek out and switch to new, better-paying jobs. Employee turnover declines as minimum wages rise. One indirect effect of raising the minimum wage is that employees stay on with companies for longer, reducing the need for new employees to be hired as frequently. Lower employee turnover rates can increase the productivity of firms because more experienced workers stay on for longer. Lower turnover rates also reduce the costs associated with the hiring process, saving money. Prices rise following increases in the minimum wage. This effect is particularly strong within sectors that employ a large share of low-wage workers, such as in food service and retail. Yet these price rises are often smaller than the rise in wages, benefiting the lowest-paid workers who are earning more as they may face slightly higher costs. Increases in wages for households in the lowest 10 percent income group are 10 times larger than increases in prices. Minimum wages also allow prices to rise consistently so that low-wage establishments are on equal ground. Increases in the minimum wage raise the prices of all low-wage establishments simultaneously. Without such an increase, an individual business—say, a restaurant—would be unwilling to increase pay if another, similar one would have relatively lower prices as a result. Increases in the minimum wage avoid this problem by raising wages for all low-wage workers employed by all firms. This is important as the majority of low-wage workers are within nontradable sectors where prices more likely to rise alongside wage costs. Minimum wage increases benefit higher-productivity firms. While low-productivity firms might see costs increase so much as to be unsustainable, more efficient firms might boost their employment, as higher wages allow them to find and keep workers. In short, minimum wages shift employment to higher-productivity firms. Workers moving into higher-productivity firms can increase the number of good jobs. Shifts in employment from low- to high-productivity firms means that low-wage workers gain higher-quality jobs. Evidence from Germany’s 15 percent minimum wage increase in 2015 showed that workers moved to higher-paying, long-term jobs at larger companies as lower-productivity companies shut down. Policy and practice implications WorkRise has identified the following implications for policy and practice: Implications for policymakers Tie minimum wages to inflation to ensure the prevalence of better jobs. Of the 30 states and the District of Columbia that have implemented a minimum wage, only a fraction have fixed this wage to increase when prices rise. High inflation in recent years highlights the need for laws of this kind to match the prices that workers pay for simple goods and services; otherwise, their purchasing power steadily diminishes. Consider the positive impacts of raising the minimum wage on overall business productivity. Policymakers interested in maximizing productivity and growth in the US economy should consider raising the minimum wage to shift low-wage workers into better, more productive jobs. Employ other solutions to protect workers from unemployment. When job losses do occur as due to increases in the minimum wage, it is important for policymakers to enact policies that can protect workers during these times, such as expanded unemployment insurance. These policies can spur increased employment and better job matching in the long run, without keeping wages low for entire sectors in the short run. Implications for businesses and practitioners Build on recent gains in worker power to demand higher minimum wages. Recent, substantial increases in state and local minimum wages can find their root in worker organizing over the past 15 years. Advocacy groups, such as the Fight for 15, have brought the attention of state and local policymakers to the economic necessity of wage increases for low-income workers. The recent rejuvenation of the worker power movement could heighten the pressure on policymakers to enact similar legislation in the coming years. Raise company wages to reduce turnover costs. Given the evidence of links between higher wages, reduced employee turnover, and the resultant rise in productivity and reduction in hiring costs, companies should consider the benefits of wage increases irrespective of minimum wage policy. Implications for researchers Study novel policy changes. Differences in state minimum wages in the past allowed researchers to then assess their impacts. With the recent flurry of state and local minimum laws over the past decade, such as in Seattle and San Francisco, there are ample new and emerging new data, through which increases in the minimum wage can be studied and the lessons from these programs can be applied. Higher minimum wages can shift low-wage US workers into good jobs and raise wages more than prices. They remain one of the best mechanisms for generating economic mobility among low-wage workers while improving many businesses’ productivity. In light of this growing body of evidence, policymakers should consider ways to implement and strengthen minimum wage policies in the future. Businesses, practitioners, and researchers, too, all have important roles to play in increasing wages for low-income workers and understanding how best these workers can contribute to stronger US business and overall economic productivity."

          "content": "On Friday, June 24, 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark piece of legislation that made access to an abortion a federal right in the United States. The decision dismantled 50 years of legal protection and paved the way for individual states to curtail or outright ban abortion rights. Already, because of trigger laws put in place before the ruling, abortion is now outlawed in many states automatically or through state action following the decision. In addition, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that certain other landmark rulings should be reconsidered, including established rights to contraception access, same-sex relationships, and same-sex marriage. Incoming Professor of Sociology Tracy Weitz is a national expert on abortion care, policy, culture, and politics. She is the co-founder and former director of the University of California San Francisco’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health research program. We asked Weitz to share her opinions on the outcomes of the overturning of Roe and what it will mean for people across the United States. Q. Roe v Wade has been overturned. What will happen now across the country? A. Nine states have already implemented their abortion bans. Another dozen states are in the process. Legal chaos is occurring as injunctions against individual state laws are being lifted and pre-Roe bans are being interpreted. In a few states, new injunctions are being issued before laws can go into effect. Governors who are hostile to abortion, but whose states have not yet fully banned abortion, are contemplating whether to call special sessions of the legislature to consider new abortion bans. Abortion providers in all the banned and several of the in-process states have stopped providing abortion care or reduced the type of care they offer. People with previously scheduled appointments are scrambling to find new appointments in states where some abortion is still available. These include abortion-safe states as well as states like Florida, Ohio, and Georgia where there are new gestational limits for abortion but not yet complete bans. Abortion clinics in states where abortion remains legal, including Illinois and Kansas, are working hard to expand appointment availability by hiring new staff, increasing the physical plant of their facilities, and adding additional clinic appointments. Clinics in the in-process states are doing their best to manage immediate increased patient demand even as they are preparing for a future in which they may not be able to continue offering abortions. Q. Who will be most impacted by this decision? What will happen if people can’t access abortions? A. The only alternative to abortion is childbirth, which has a 14 times higher risk of death than that abortion. So, in denying a person access to a wanted abortion, states are forcing people to assume significant medical risk against their will. A recent study out of Colorado ominously predicts a significant rise in the maternal mortality rate, especially among Black women who already experience an unacceptably high rate of death in childbearing. Research from the Turn Away study demonstrated other deleterious impacts of being denied a wanted abortion. This study followed ~1000 self-identified women for five years after receiving or being denied a wanted abortion. They found that denying these women an abortion creates economic hardship and insecurity that lasts for years. Compared with women who obtained their desired abortion, women denied the abortion had lowered credit scores as well as increased debt, bankruptcies, and evictions. Women turned away from getting an abortion were also more likely to stay in contact with a violent partner. The financial well-being and development of prior and subsequent children was also negatively impacted. Finally, giving birth was connected to more serious long-term health problems than having an abortion. Q. Can you tell us a bit about the people who choose to get an abortion — and the reasons why? A. Abortion is a health care option most frequently needed by people affected by the structural inequalities of poverty, racism, and xenophobia. Almost 75 percent of US abortion patients live at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level. More than 50 percent of abortion patients are women of color, and 60 percent of all patients already have children. People’s reasons for abortion are as complex as their individual lives, and I fundamentally believe no one should have to justify their reason for abortion; simply wanting to no longer be pregnant, or needing an abortion to save their own life, is enough. Q. What does this mean for doctors who perform abortions in states where it will be curtailed or outlawed? A. In all the states where abortion is being banned, physicians stopped providing abortion care immediately after the decision, or will do so after their state law takes effect. In some states where abortion is now banned, significant medical care was provided by physicians who traveled from outside the state. These physicians will likely start providing care in one of the places where abortions remain legal, and demand is increasing. However, there are other skilled and dedicated physicians who have provided abortion care for decades to women in their communities. Some of these physicians offer other types of health care and will continue to do so, without offering the abortion care their patients need. Those physicians who only provided abortions will need to decide whether to retire or relocate. Other clinical staff including nurses, social workers, patient counselors, and medical assistants are also losing their jobs and their ability to provide economically for their families. Women in communities across the abortion-banned states have relied on these teams of health care providers to care for them during an important time in their lives. It is cruel what is happening to pregnant people, and it is cruel what is happening to the dedicated staff that make up the abortion providers of this country. Q. What is the difference between emergency contraception and medication abortion? A. Emergency contraception (EC) and medication abortion are not the same thing: they use different drugs that work differently on the body. EC stops pregnancy from happening. Medication abortion ends an already existing pregnancy. One brand of EC, Plan B, is available over the counter without a prescription. Medication abortion requires a clinical consultation (either via a telehealth visit or a visit to a clinic). EC can be used up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, while medication abortion is used between the time of a missed period (usually four weeks) and 11 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Q. How will this ruling affect women’s access to each? A. At this time, abortion bans include bans of medication abortion. Emergency contraception is not included in abortion bans. However, many politicians who are hostile to abortion also disagree with emergency contraception, and we may see efforts to restrict access to EC in the future. The FDA could help expand access to EC by approving the second EC option, Ella, as an over-the-counter drug. Plan B is less effective for people of higher body weight, and Ella helps ensure these people also have access to an EC option. At this time, clinicians who provide medication abortion via telehealth can only provide it in states where abortion remains legal. Abortion-supportive states that wish to ensure access to abortion in states where it is banned could protect clinicians in their state who provide abortion care to people in banned states. The Federal government could explore ways to protect this practice. Until then, people who need medication abortion in states where abortion is banned can self-source these medications from international telehealth providers or international pharmacies. Q. Almost 90 percent of abortions occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Can you tell us some of the reasons why women need to have abortions later in pregnancy? A. Many people do not know they are pregnant until after the 12th week: some are still bleeding, others are on medications that caused cycle changes, and still other people do not have pregnancy symptoms. Another reason people pass the 12th week of pregnancy is that gathering the money to pay for the abortion is extremely hard. Currently, the Federal government and 33 states prohibit people from using Medicaid to pay for abortions. Yet the majority of people who need abortion live at or below poverty. In order to gather the money, they forgo paying rent or food bills, and all of this delays their ability to obtain an abortion when they first want one. And after they pass the 12 weeks mark, the cycle perpetuates itself. The cost of the abortion begins to increase as the clinical care becomes more complex, thus requiring more money and causing more delays. For still other people, the abortion decision is made following learning something about their own health status or the health status of the fetus. Medical complications in pregnancy increase as people become more pregnant, and some do not onset until later in pregnancy. Issues with the growth of the fetus occur as the fetus develops and are not diagnosable until later in pregnancy. Q. Then what will happen now if a mother’s life is in danger? A. We do not have data on how often a pregnancy threatens a person’s life because this care has often occurred in hospital settings, which do not routinely advertise that they do abortions. Physicians who treat these pregnancies, including maternal fetal medicine and complex family planning physicians, rarely discuss these cases publicly, in part because of the social discomfort with abortions later in pregnancies. Limited research on hospital policies regarding abortion care demonstrates significant barriers to obtaining institutional support for abortions, regardless of the reason. Now that abortion is banned in some states, it is likely that access to abortion care in life-threatening circumstances will be even harder to provide. The media is already reporting cases in which life-saving care was denied to pregnant patients. We can expect to see more of this since the penalty for violating an abortion ban is criminal jail time for the physician and other legal consequences for the institution. The Federal government can help ensure that needed care is provided by identifying and prosecuting denials of care under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act and covering such life-saving care under the exceptions to the federal Hyde amendment. Q. Are you concerned about the fate of other rights that are not explicitly outlined in the Constitution, including the right to access contraception? Do you think this is a real possibility, and what would this mean for our society? A. I am not a legal scholar, so I cannot predict what the Court will do to other legal rights based in the constitutional right to privacy. What I can speak to is that most social conservatives do not draw a hard-line distinction between abortion and contraception. The Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision allowed a corporation to not cover contraceptive methods that its owners believed were abortifacients, namely emergency contraception and intrauterine devices (IUDs). So, it is likely that some state legislatures will seek to limit access to some contraceptive methods or to further limit contraceptive access to people whose sexual lives they disagree with. Too frequently, people see abortion as the exception in law and policy. I would suggest that it is exemplar. The 50-year effort to overturn Roe is part of a larger effort to reverse the wider progressive gains in social, economic, gender, and racial advancement. Q. What is the bottom line? As someone who has focused on abortion care and policy for your entire career, what do you think American should know right now? A. I have heard a lot of people concerned about the risk of people dying from unsafe abortion. One positive advancement since the pre-Roe days is the availability of abortion pills that people can use to end a pregnancy safely with minimal clinical involvement. Today in the United States, these pills are dispensed by abortion clinics as part of a health care visit, increasing through telehealth. As abortion providers become unavailable in many places, people will turn to the Internet to order these pills directly, either through an international telehealth service like Aid Access or from an online pharmacy operating outside the United States. Data from studies around the world show us that such self-sourcing of abortion pills is safe, effective, and acceptable for people. So even as the public expresses their anger about the elimination of the fundamental rights of people to bodily autonomy, they should not exaggerate the medical risk of self-managed abortions. Deaths will happen, but likely resulting from people carrying pregnancies to term against their will. Self-managed abortion with pills is safe — that is what I want people to know. What is so wrong is that people who would prefer to receive this care from a trusted health care provider will instead have to shop for drugs online, potentially putting themselves at criminal risk for breaking the law."

          "content": "On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade, ending women’s constitutional right to an abortion after nearly half a century. Following the announcement, a number of states moved swiftly to enact restrictive laws that have already changed the abortion landscape for women across the country. At the time this issue went to press, 12 states have banned abortion, and five have imposed gestational limits to the procedure as early as six weeks. According to The Washington Post, 1 in 3 women in the United States have lost their access to abortion, and in the months to come, more abortion bans and restrictions are expected to go into effect. Below, experts at the College speak out about the potential consequences of this decision and how the ruling will impact their fields of study. Image Miriam Neptune Miriam Neptune Senior Associate Director, Barnard Center for Research on Women (BCRW) The Court’s decision on Dobbs v. Jackson is devastating because it denies those of us who can give birth the right to safely access a procedure that has always been a necessary part of reproductive healthcare. But the decision is also a chilling reminder that so many of us — gender nonbinary, trans, queer, Black, immigrant, Indigenous, disabled people, and financially vulnerable women — are still not seen as fully human in the eyes of the State, and our bodies are often criminalized. We now have to struggle even more fiercely for reproductive justice — the ability to maintain autonomy over our bodies, live free from systemic violence and harm, and sustain the kinds of families we want to form. Questions of bodily autonomy have always been central at BCRW, which held its first conference one month after the 1973 Roe decision, and we will continue to use our archives, publications, and events to support activists, artists, and scholars who are teaching and organizing around these issues. Image Janet Jakobsen Janet Jakobsen Claire Tow Professor of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies In particular, the debate over Roe v. Wade is often framed as one between religious morality, where “religion” predominantly means conservative Christianity, and a secular commitment to gender equality. This framing is misleading, and each of the fields I work in speaks to the problem somewhat differently. The leading view of the field of women’s studies is that the basic protection provided by Roe v. Wade should be placed within a broader framework of racial justice, economic possibility, and community well-being. The Reproductive Justice framework, which has been developed through the leadership of women of color in activist organizations like SisterSong in Atlanta, broadens the framework for understanding the importance of reproductive issues and why they are connected to many struggles for justice. SisterSong defines reproductive justice as “the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities.” Reproduction is not a side issue but a necessary part of creating safe and sustainable communities, and, concomitantly, creating safe and sustainable communities is necessary to support everyone’s reproductive lives. The loss of even the basic protection offered by Roe takes U.S. society away from the social relations that will allow people to have and raise children in safe and sustainable communities. Without Roe and a recognition of the need for reproductive justice, U.S. society is further away from the possibility of jobs with a living wage that could support families, or of a world without police violence, or of a safe educational environment for all children. Framing the debate about Roe v. Wade as a conflict between religious morality and gender equality makes it seems as though one group’s rights will inevitably triumph over another. It seems that either religion or gender equality must prevail. Instead, debate over Roe v. Wade can better be understood as a question of religious freedom for everyone. Religious views on abortion have varied historically, both within religious traditions, including Christianity, and among religious traditions. Different traditions have different views of abortion. For those who believe that life begins at conception, their freedom to organize their lives in relation to this belief is not threatened. Roe offered protection against the use of the force of law to impose this belief on people who do not share it. Religious freedom protects both religious people, whatever their tradition, and those who are not religious from having to organize their lives according to religious values, beliefs, and traditions they do not share. The loss of Roe then, not only puts significant burdens on reproductive health and the possibility of safe and sustainable communities as advocated in the reproductive justice framework, it is also a step away from the promise of religious freedom for all. Image Elizabeth Ananat Elizabeth Ananat Mallya Professor of Women and Economics We know from a very robust body of research that growing up in poverty harms children across virtually all dimensions, hurting their health, educational attainment, earnings, and more. Women in the U.S. face large earnings penalties for having children across socioeconomic levels and, in particular, are highly likely to enter poverty directly after a child is born — thanks to a lack of paid leave, a lack of affordable child care, and a lack of the type of child allowance common in other rich countries. That’s the case even now, with legal access to abortion, in a context where women are able to plan their families and their births for when it’s the best time in terms of their work and family situation. We also know from recent research that has followed women who were unable to get an abortion under new laws — because they came to a clinic just after, instead of just before, a gestational cutoff in their state — that they are much more likely to be poor in the years afterward, much more likely to get evicted, in much worse mental and physical health, and more likely to be in an abusive relationship. Their existing children — 60% of women seeking an abortion are already mothers — end up with poorer developmental outcomes. All of these results portend badly for women’s futures and their children’s. In other words, when more women lose the right to choose whether their current circumstances are the best ones into which to bring a new child — economically and in terms of their education, career, and family context — there will be more women and children facing material hardship, dealing with poor health, and enduring domestic violence. So the benefits of legalized abortion are quite great today, and there will be major costs to losing it. Image Nara Milanich Nara Milanich Professor of History This is a devastating moment for proponents of reproductive rights and justice in the U.S., but it is not the first time that advocates have faced such a sobering political landscape. In Latin America, feminists have long faced powerful resistance to reproductive rights — from conservatives, the Catholic Church, evangelicals, but even from parts of the left. As recently as five years ago, 97% of people in Latin America and the Caribbean lived in countries where abortion was illegal or severely restricted. But today, the three largest Spanish-speaking countries — Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia — have decriminalized abortion. They followed different legislative and judicial processes to get there, but there are patterns we can learn from: the importance of mass mobilization; the importance of a broad framing of reproductive justice — in which it’s about access for all, not just choice for some; the creation of alliances across different groups in society; and the formation of networks of solidarity across national borders. The experiences of Latin American feminists also show that a grim political panorama can lead to innovative new political and healthcare strategies. Nayla Vacarezza, associate researcher at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research in Argentina, and I give an example of this in our article [“Latin America’s Lessons for a Post-Roe United States,” Foreign Affairs]: the formation of networks of acompañantes who assist women with self-managed, medical abortions. These networks have expanded abortion access in countries where it is illegal. Image Cecelia Lie-Spahn Cecelia Lie-Spahn Lecturer, English; Associate Director of the First-Year Writing Program, Director of the First-Year Writing Workshop Program There is no question that overturning Roe v. Wade — and decades of stare decisis [a legal principle that obligates courts to respect precedents established by prior decisions] affirming its validity — will exacerbate existing reproductive health inequities. As we have known forever, criminalizing abortion does nothing to stop the need for abortion, and activists have long worked to help fill this major healthcare gap, sometimes via extralegal means. Many point to medication abortion as a way for people to continue accessing safe abortion where it is illegal, and this is an excellent option when people can access the mifepristone-misoprostol combination pills that are FDA approved and routinely prescribed. Since the 1980s, women in much of South America have learned and taught one another how to use misoprostol, originally an ulcer drug, alone to induce abortion. Misoprostol — also known as Cytotec or “miso” for short — is more readily available than the FDA-approved and routinely prescribed combination of mifepristone followed by misoprostol. Over the past few decades that miso has been in underground circulation, women have become extremely knowledgeable about how to use it as safely and effectively as possible. The collective support and knowledge-sharing about miso that has grown into a transnational movement is a powerful reminder of our ability to organize, to know and care for our bodies and each other, and to pursue our needs despite the legal landscape. We must also address the conditions that make this work necessary. The reality is, in this country, we are continually subjecting the most vulnerable communities to the worst care. Abortion is one issue among many — reproductive and otherwise — that powerfully impact all kinds of health outcomes. While Roe v. Wade never promised reproductive freedom — no law can — it has helped stymie persistent threats to women’s bodily autonomy, and it has been overturned at a time when the extreme right is becoming most creative with the law, empowering anti-abortion folks to sue not only medical professionals who are suspected of providing abortions but also activists doing the collective, movement-building work of assisting and supporting women in their pursuit of safe abortions and other health needs."

ByJack Moore November 28, 2025, 6:14 PM 1:55 Trump admin announces pause on asylum decisions after National Guardsmen shooting Trump admin announces pause on asylum decisions after National Guardsmen shootingThe Trump administration announced on Friday that it is pausing all asylum decisions following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., earlier this week. The Trump administration announced on Friday that it is pausing all asylum decisions following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., earlier this week. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said all asylum decisions are being halted “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.” The announcement comes after President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would 'permanently pause migration' from some countries. At the time, he did not specify which countries the pause would affect, but said it would apply to 'Third World Countries.' 1 of 2 National Guard members wounded in 'targeted shooting' has died, Trump says Additionally, the State Department has 'immediately' paused issuing visas for travelers with Afghan passports. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted a statement on X, saying, 'President Trump’s State Department has paused visa issuance for ALL individuals traveling on Afghan passports. The United States has no higher priority than protecting our nation and our people.' In June, Trump issued a proclamation banning travel to the U.S. from 12 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, and imposing travel restrictions on several others. In the post on Thursday, Trump also listed a number of actions he said the U.S. would take, though it’s not yet clear how the Trump administration plans to accomplish them. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on the attack in Washington on the National Guard soldiers during an address from Palm Beach, Fla., Nov. 26, 2025. The White House He said the U.S. would 'terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.' The suspect in Wednesday's shooting, which claimed the life of one National Guard member and left the other in critical condition, is 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal. What to know about the 29-year-old suspected gunman in the National Guardsmen shooting Officials say Lakanwal came to the U.S. in 2021 during the Biden administration. He was granted asylum in April 2025 under Trump, according to multiple law enforcement sources. In Afghanistan, the suspect was involved with the Zero Unit, working closely with the CIA and the Joint Special Operations Command, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The suspect was a trusted member of that team, which went after U.S. counterterrorism targets, according to sources. Trump has vowed an immigration crackdown following the shooting, saying Wednesday the attack 'underscores the greatest national security threat facing our nation.' Trump vows immigration crackdown following DC shooting of National Guard members In the past, Democrats and immigration advocates have pushed back against the president's immigration restrictions, including on asylum seekers, contending that he has exaggerated national security concerns and turned away millions of families in need. Trump ordered National Guard troops to Washington this summer. He has also ordered members of the National Guard to other Democrat-led cities such as Chicago and Portland, Oregon."

          "content": "WASHINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is moving to clamp down on legal immigration into the U.S. after an Afghan immigrant was accused of ambushing National Guard members, a crackdown that echoes Trump's first-term restrictions and could face similar challenges. Less than two days after authorities said Rahmanullah Lakanwal opened fire on guard members, killing one and critically wounding another, Trump halted processing of Afghan immigration applications, ordered a review of all people approved for asylum in the previous administration, and signaled he would expand vetting under a travel ban on people coming from 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritized immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major U.S. cities and turning away asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push but put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration. The flurry of promised restrictions since the attack on Wednesday now suggests an increased focus by his administration on legal immigration framed around protecting national security and casting blame on former President Joe Biden for more liberal policies. While some restrictions rolled out in recent days are new - such as pausing all Afghan immigration applications - others build on Trump policies that stretch back to his 2017-2021 presidency. \"I think they're just going to potentially accelerate their plans, the plans they've had all along the way, which are not making us safer,\" said Doug Rand, a former senior adviser at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under Biden. TRUMP LOSES GROUND ON IMMIGRATION WITH AMERICANS Critics say the Trump administration is using an isolated incident to unfairly demonize immigrants from Afghanistan and other nations labeled as security risks. \"This violent act does not reflect the Afghan community, which continues to contribute across the United States and undergoes some of the most extensive vetting of any immigrant population,\" the group AfghanEvac, a coalition of veterans and others to support Afghan immigrants, said in a statement. In an interview with Fox News, Republican U.S. Representative Mike Lawler of New York blamed the Biden administration for ineffective vetting of refugees from Afghanistan, but said the U.S. should not abandon its commitment to Afghans who aided U.S. forces during the 20-year war there. \"We want to make sure that everybody is very clearly vetted, that they meet the strictest of requirements,\" he said. \"But I want to stress, you cannot cast aspersions on every single person that came from Afghanistan.\" Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration, said some immigrants come from countries from which the U.S. receives limited or unreliable information, or where terror groups operate, making vetting difficult. \"We have to be more careful with applicants from these places,\" she said. The new Trump push to restrict legal immigration comes as he has lost ground with Americans on his signature policy issue. Reuters/Ipsos polls show Trump's approval rating on immigration has faltered as his administration has surged masked immigration agents to U.S. cities in recent months, generating pushback from residents. Some 41% approved of Trump's handling of immigration as of mid-November, down from a peak of 50% in mid-March, Reuters/Ipsos polls show. OFFICIALS VOW MAJOR RESTRICTIONS BUT TAKE MORE LIMITED STEPS Over the past two days, Trump and top officials have suggested on social media that the administration could implement sweeping changes to the legal immigration system but U.S. agencies so far have announced more limited actions. In a late-night post to his Truth Social platform on Thursday, Trump said his administration would \"permanently pause\" migration from all \"Third World Countries.\" When asked for a list of the countries, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security pointed to the 19 countries covered by Trump's existing travel ban - 12 of which already face complete bans, including Afghanistan. Joe Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in an X post on Thursday that he had ordered \"a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.\" In an announcement hours later, USCIS said the review would focus on the 19 travel ban countries and be limited to pending or future applications. The Department of Homeland Security said after the attack that it was reviewing all asylum cases approved during the Biden administration. BROAD REOPENING OF CASES WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED The review comes in addition to a similar effort launched last week to re-examine refugees who entered the country from abroad under Biden's administration. Michael Valverde, a former USCIS associate director of operations, said the agency frequently reviews concerning cases but that a broad reopening of hundreds of thousands of cases would be unprecedented. \"It would be very time consuming and likely would increase delays to those waiting for their initial decisions,\" he said. In his post on Truth Social, Trump also said he would end federal benefits for non-citizens, denaturalize \"migrants who undermine domestic tranquility,\" and deport immigrants who are \"non-compatible with Western civilization.\" Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, said stripping federal benefits from all non-citizens would be quickly struck down by courts. The Supreme Court ruled in 1971 that it was unconstitutional to restrict welfare benefits to only U.S. citizens. \"Especially with respect to people who are lawfully here, where benefits are guaranteed by statute, that's an easy call for the federal courts,\" Chishti said. The Trump administration has already sought to make denaturalizations - stripping citizenship from immigrants - more of a focus. But any effort to deport immigrants solely on their perceived compatibility with Western civilization would be novel and almost certainly face legal challenges. In response to a request for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson accused Democrats of blocking efforts to remove potential threats. \"The Trump administration is taking every measure possible – in the face of unrelenting Democrat opposition – to get these monsters out of our country and clean up the mess made by the Biden administration,\" she said. Democrats say Trump's immigration crackdown has swept up non-criminals and split apart families rather than focusing on serious criminal offenders."

          "content": "Why Gun Control Doesn’t Work The Second Amendment guarantees law-abiding Americans the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. But over time, gun control laws have placed limits on that freedom. Some politicians and gun control proponents argue that these laws are necessary — even at the cost of infringing upon a fundamental American right. But the fact is, gun control doesn’t work the way advocates argue it does. What is Gun Control? Gun control is an umbrella term that refers to laws and ordinances that restrict how law-abiding citizens can buy, own, or use firearms. These vary at the federal, state, and local levels. This means that while the Second Amendment protects your Right to Keep and Bear Arms, there may be different restrictions placed upon that right depending on where you live. Gun control at the local level ranges widely. For example, in some towns, citizens who are licensed to carry concealed firearms cannot do so in public parks. And in Chicago, it’s unlawful to own most semi-automatic firearms. Federal gun control legislation like the Gun Control Act of 1968and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1993) created nationwide requirements that make it more difficult to obtain a firearm. These laws have been in place for decades, and by now, the evidence is crystal clear. Gun control doesn’t work. Some of the key reasons are detailed below. Criminals Don’t Obey Gun Control Laws Criminals, by definition, do not obey the law. Gun control laws only affect law-abiding people who go through legal avenues to obtain firearms. Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws. That’s why background checks have virtually no impact on criminals. A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source. The vast majority of criminals obtained their firearms through other means, including: [1] Illegal underground sales Bought, borrowed, traded, or rented from friends or family Gifts Purchased by another individual for them Theft From their victims From the scene of a crime Criminals who go through illegal avenues to obtain firearms aren't going to submit to background checks while doing so. Ultimately, only law-abiding citizens would be impacted by expanded background checks. Background Checks Aren’t Effective Even if criminals did submit to background checks, we’ve seen that these checks aren’t effective at stopping those who intend to use guns to commit crimes. Consider the following scenarios. A person with no criminal history walks into a store to buy a gun they’ll use to commit a crime. A background check most likely won’t stop them. A drug addict lies about their addiction on a federal background check form. Although this individual is committing a federal crime, a background check most likely won’t stop them. A person with serious mental health issues but no history of treatment or institutionalization goes to buy a gun. A background check most likely won’t stop them. It makes sense then that background checks have no impact on violent crime. Just take a look at California, a state that’s had background checks in place for decades. In 2018, a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades (1981-2000) of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California. [2] Again and again, firearm background checks have proven to be ineffective. What we do know is that they simply make the gun buying process more difficult for law-abiding citizens. Crime Goes Down When Good Guys Have Guns On the other hand, allowing law-abiding citizens to more easily access firearms does help reduce violent crime. Gun control advocates have long promoted the idea that making firearms more accessible would increase crime. But time has told a different story. Gun ownership is up, and violent crime is down overall. Let’s look over some quick facts: Over the past three decades (1991-2019), violent crime rates have dropped by more than half. The number of privately-owned firearms in the United States doubled in that same period. [3][4] The number of people carrying a firearm for protection outside the home has also risen to all-time highs as violent crime dropped. [5] Mass murderers have repeatedly been deterred or stopped by citizens carrying lawfully concealed firearms. [6] Concealed carry laws help reduce the number of rapes and robberies overall. [7] It makes sense that criminals would be far less likely to commit a crime if they believed their victim might be armed. In fact, a major study of 2,000 felons in state and federal prisons across the United States showed that criminals actually fear armed citizens more than they fear the police. [8] Cities with the Strictest Gun Control Have the Highest Crime Rates Does gun control reduce crime? The evidence says no. In fact, cities with some of the most stringent gun laws, like New York and Chicago, suffer from some of the highest violent crime rates. Shooting and murder rates in Chicago surged 50% in 2020, and that city recorded the highest number of gun-related homicides on record. [9] Gun-controlled Chicago became the most murderous city in the country. New York City saw similarly alarming statistics. In 2020, homicides increased 41%, and shootings increased an astounding 95%. [10] Studies have shown that homicide rates tend to rise when law-abiding citizens are unable to own and carry firearms for self-defense. [11] And the recent statistics from some of the country’s most anti-gun cities confirm this conclusion. Gun control doesn’t work, so what does? The Solution: Crime Control The simplest solution is crime control — enforcing existing laws aimed at criminals who carry and use firearms to commit their crimes. We know that homicides in cities trend down when elected officials encourage solid police work and harsh penalties for gun criminals. We’ve seen it work in past years in Chicago when the city gave additional resources to law enforcement. We’ve known for decades that crime control works. A good example is \"Project Exile,\" a program launched in Richmond, Virginia in 1997. Faced with a sky-high homicide rate, Richmond prosecutors began enforcing existing gun laws to the fullest, imposing lengthy sentences against drug dealers and other criminals who were carrying firearms illegally. The project was an enormous success. Law enforcement took hundreds of illegal guns off the street, and Richmond's homicide rate plummeted. [12] Other cities implemented the program with similar success. In short, \"Project Exile\" demonstrated beyond a doubt that focusing on gun criminals, not placing undue burden on law-abiding citizens, is the best way to curb violent crime and make the American people safe."
