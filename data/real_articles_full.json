          "content": "Are entry-level jobs on the way out? For decades, entry-level roles have provided essential training grounds for newcomers to step into the world of work. From finance to journalism, junior staff have traditionally handled the ‘grunt work’ as a rite of passage as much as a development opportunity. But as AI reshapes the career ladder, these early entry points could be increasingly at risk, according to Bloomberg. International Workers Day, on 1 May, signifies the labour movement’s struggle for the rights of workers. AI stands as one of the most significant challenges – and opportunities – facing the labour market today. While 170 million new jobs are projected to be created this decade, the rise of AI-powered tools threatens to automate as many roles as it creates, particularly for white collar, entry-level roles. Bloomberg finds that AI could replace more than 50% of the tasks performed by market research analysts (53%) and sales representatives (67%), compared to just 9% and 21% for their managerial counterparts. Whether by narrowing entry pathways or making roles that once required specialized skills more accessible, estimates suggest that AI could impact nearly 50 million US jobs in the coming years. How AI could be closing the door on talent... The Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 reveals that 40% of employers expect to reduce their workforce where AI can automate tasks. Technology, overall, is projected to be the most disruptive force in the labour market, with trends in AI and information processing technology expected to create 11 million jobs, while simultaneously displacing 9 million others. As entry-level roles decline, salary expectations are also shifting, with remaining hires expected to take on roles supported by AI for less money. A recent survey found that 49% of US Gen Z job hunters believe AI has reduced the value of their college education in the job market. At the same time, US firms are expanding business operations in India, where skilled professionals can be employed at significantly lower costs, Charter points out, further intensifying competition for white-collar roles. But this can create a talent pipeline problem, with significant implications for social mobility and equal representation, Bloomberg says. ...while also opening new doors Gen AI could democratize access to jobs, making it easier to build the technical knowledge and skills that have historically excluded otherwise qualified workers, according to Charter. Rather than eliminating entry-level opportunities altogether, companies could harness AI to train the next generation of senior professionals. From law firms saying goodbye to the billable hour to more emphasis on apprenticeships, traditional structures could be redefined. As Gen AI becomes further embedded in the workplace, companies will need to invest in substantial upskilling efforts to prepare their employees for the AI-driven economy. Alongside global macroeconomic trends, AI is set to reshape the traditional career ladder, with entry-level jobs at risk. But employers and employees alike can prioritize upskilling, education efforts and levelling the playing field that comes with harnessing AI’s potential."

          "title": "Incorporating AI impacts in BLS employment projections: occupational case studies",
          "source": "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics — Monthly Labor Review (Feb 2025)",
          "stance": "neutral",

          "content": "In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly, finding growing applications across industries and occupations. This development has generated interest in how the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics assesses and incorporates AI’s potential labor market impacts in its employment projections. In this article, we explain the Bureau’s approach to this type of projections work, illustrating it with several occupational case studies based on research done for the 2023–33 projections cycle. The case studies focus on selected occupations in the computer, legal, business and financial, and architecture and engineering occupational groups. Discussions about advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have become commonplace. In recent years, such advances have received constant news coverage, especially since the deployment of Open AI’s ChatGPT in November 2022.[1] ChatGPT, a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology that allows users to have humanlike conversations, was the first to offer many users the opportunity to directly experience the potential power of AI in their lives. Millions of Americans have since used ChatGPT.[2] Although AI and chatbots are not new, ChatGPT and similar tools have opened a new portal into the world of large language models (LLMs) and their wide-ranging applications.[3] Generative AI (GenAI) tools are becoming increasingly powerful in creating prose, images, videos, and sound. Because of the sheer potential of these tools, many people have been asking how they might affect our future, including that of workers and employment. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment Projections (EP) program approaches AI in the same way as it does other technologies.[4] Established technologies and other structural changes to the labor market have impacts that register in the historical data.[5] BLS projection methods are designed to measure and reflect structural technological changes, and these changes and their employment impacts tend to occur gradually.[6] There have been many claims about new technologies displacing jobs, and although such displacement has occurred in the past, it tends to take longer than technologists typically expect. Various technologies have had occupational impacts throughout recent history, but many affected occupations have still seen employment growth. Although it is always possible that future developments will deviate from historical patterns, BLS projection methods are not designed to capture extremely rapid technological change and, therefore, assume that the overall pace of technological change will be consistent with past experience. Projecting future employment involves substantial uncertainty, especially in the case of evaluating the future impacts of a developing technology. BLS acknowledges this uncertainty in analyzing the relative likelihood of employment impacts across occupations. In this article, we use case studies to illustrate how BLS considers various factors of uncertainty in its employment projections. The next section provides more details, along with illustrative examples, on how BLS has approached this type of projections work in the past. The section after that presents several case studies, based on EP research done for the 2023–33 projections cycle, examining the potential employment impacts of AI technological advancements on selected occupations in the computer, legal, business and financial, and architecture and engineering occupational groups. The final section concludes, summarizing our results and noting EP’s plans for future research. Background and research considerations. EP research connects the potential employment impacts of a new technology with data trends. The goal of this approach is to determine whether these impacts are likely to continue as the new technology grows in adoption and maturation or whether they are likely to diminish as the benefits of the technology are fully realized. For an emerging technology that is not yet reflected in historical data, EP aims to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion about the direction and magnitude of the technology’s future impact on the labor market. One illustrative example of how this research has affected BLS projections involves photographic process workers. To show a decline in labor demand for this occupation in the early 2000s, when digital cameras were on the verge of displacing most film cameras, EP adjusted its models accordingly. Digital cameras improved on an already-existing technology, and the path to integrating them into business operations and consumer lives was clear. Digital cameras were already replacing film cameras, and the employment impacts of this shift were directly implied by the speed and maturation of technological change. Despite the absence of historical data showing employment declines for photographic process workers, EP projected that employment in the occupation would decline 23.6 percent from 2004 to 2014. Indeed, employment in the occupation started to fall precipitously in the early 2000s, declining from a peak of 86,300 in 2004 to 28,800 in 2014, with a further decline to only 9,200 in 2023.[7] The potential for AI, particularly GenAI, to disrupt future employment has been a prominent topic in recent economic commentary. BLS employment projections consider and reflect the productivity-enhancing effects of automation and a wide range of technologies, including AI, on occupations and industries. Over the 2023–33 projections period, AI is expected to primarily affect occupations whose core tasks can be most easily replicated by GenAI in its current form. These occupations include medical transcriptionists and customer service representatives, whose employment is projected to decline by 4.7 and 5.0 percent, respectively, through 2033.[49] Other occupations also may see AI impacts, although not to the same extent. For instance, computer occupations may see productivity impacts from AI, but the need to implement and maintain AI infrastructure could in actuality boost demand for some occupations in this group. Among legal occupations, paralegals and legal assistants are likely to experience lower employment demand because of LLM adoption, while lawyers are expected to be less affected. Within business and financial operations occupations, insurance adjusters and appraisers are expected to see reduced employment demand, with AI being able to quickly produce monetary estimates of property damage. Meanwhile, other occupations in this group, such as personal financial advisors, will likely continue to see strong employment growth because demand for human counsel in complex financial matters will persist, particularly for older clients. Architecture and engineering occupations may see some productivity gains from GenAI, but these gains will likely be in line with those afforded by software and other technological advancements in prior decades. As a result, occupations in this group are not expected to see substantial GenAI-driven reductions in employment demand over the projections period. Each year, BLS issues new 10-year projections that incorporate new data, research, and analysis. EP continually conducts research on new technologies, including AI and LLMs, to better understand their potential employment and economic impacts over the projections period. Besides reflecting these findings in its 10-year projections, the program also evaluates previous projections, explores shifts among skills that are in demand, and considers the potential for technology to create new types of jobs. EP will continue to monitor AI as it evolves, ensuring that BLS projections reflect an updated assessment of the latest developments in this technology and its likely employment impacts."

          "content": "Over the past several months, the Trump administration has implemented key aspects of its economic policies by raising tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners and winning final congressional passage of its sweeping tax and budget bill, officially titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Chart shows Roughly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump administration’s tariff policies The public’s views on these policies remain more negative than positive. A 61% majority of Americans disapprove of the Trump administration increasing tariffs on goods imported from most countries that trade with the United States, while 38% approve. These views are largely unchanged since April, shortly after Trump unveiled his far-reaching tariffs policy. Note: This survey was in the field on Aug. 7, when the Trump administration imposed higher import taxes on scores of countries, including tariffs as high as 50% for some countries.   By a wide margin, Republicans approve of the administration’s tariff and trade policies while Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove: 68% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approve of the increased tariffs. 89% of Democrats and Democratic leaners disapprove. Americans continue to express more negative than positive views of the GOP’s tax and budget legislation, which Trump signed into law on July 4. Only about a third (32%) approve of the legislation, while 46% disapprove. And by wide margins, more say the long-term effects of the legislation will be negative rather than positive. View of Trump’s handling of the economy also remain negative. A 55% majority say they are not too confident or not at all confident in Trump’s ability to make good decisions on economic policy, which is virtually unchanged from April. How will the Trump administration’s tariff policies impact the country and Americans personally? Majorities of Americans say the long-term effects of the administration’s tariff policies will be mostly negative for the country (55%) and for themselves and their families (also 55%). Chart shows Majorities of Americans say Trump’s tariff policies will have mostly negative effects in the long run While there are partisan differences in these views, Republicans express mixed views of the impacts of the tariffs, while Democrats are largely negative.  The country as a whole More than twice as many Americans say the tariffs will have mostly negative effects on the country in coming years (55%) as say the effects will be mostly positive (26%). About one-in-five (19%) expect the effects will be about equally positive and negative. About half of Republicans and GOP leaners (52%) anticipate that the tariffs will benefit the country in the long term, while 27% see mixed positive and negative effects; 21% expect the tariffs to negatively affect the country in coming years. By comparison, nearly nine-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (87%) say the tariffs will have negative effects on the country in coming years.     Americans and their families When asked about the effect of such policies on them and their families, overall views are similar: 55% of adults say they expect the personal impact to be mostly negative in coming years, while 21% say it will be mostly positive. Roughly a quarter say the effect will be about equally positive and negative. Notably, Republicans are less likely to say the tariffs will have mostly positive effects on themselves and their families (40%) than on the country (52%) in the coming years. They are somewhat more likely to say the personal impact will be mixed (35%, compared with 27% who say this about the country). Democrats, by contrast, are nearly as skeptical of the long-term personal impact of the tariffs (84% say it will be mostly negative) as they are of their effect on the country (87%). More Americans disapprove than approve of GOP’s tax and budget law Just over a month since being passed into law, the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” continues to be viewed more negatively than positively: 46% of Americans disapprove of the law, while 32% approve. Another 23% are not sure. Chart shows About a third of Americans approve of GOP’s tax and budget bill, while nearly half disapprove These views have changed little since June, prior to the passing of the bill by the Senate, when 49% of adults said they opposed the budget and tax bill proposed by Trump and Republicans in Congress and 29% favored it. There continue to be wide partisan differences in views of the legislation: Six-in-ten Republicans say they approve of the budget and tax law, while 17% disapprove and 23% are not sure. Democrats disapprove of the law by an overwhelming margin (75% to 6%), with 18% not sure. Democratic opposition to the law is far more intense than Republican support for it. While 61% of Democrats strongly disapprove of the measure, just 21% of Republicans strongly approve. Overall, far more Americans say the tax and budget law will have mostly negative effects than mostly positive effects. Chart shows About half of Republicans see long-term benefits from the GOP’s tax and budget bill; far more Democrats say it will have negative impacts Nearly half (47%) say the law will have a mostly negative effect on the country in coming years, while 25% expect mostly positive effects. About a quarter (26%) say the results will be mixed. Views are fairly similar regarding the law’s personal impact. As with overall opinions about the law, negative opinions about the effects of the law among Democrats far surpass positive views among Republicans. About eight-in-ten Democrats (78%) say the law’s effect on the country over the coming years will be mostly negative. A smaller share of Republicans (48%) say it will have a mostly positive impact. Partisans are similarly divided when it comes to the effect of the budget and tax law on them and their families: Seven-in-ten Democrats say the impact of the law will be mostly negative on them and their families, and 46% of Republicans say it will be mostly positive."

          "content": "For all the “sky-is-falling” cries over President Donald Trump’s tariffs, it looks like his strategy may be working — just as his Aug. 1 deadline nears. In the past week, the Trump folks struck deals with Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines — and may be on the verge of a deal with Europe: On Friday, the prez cited a 50-50 chance of reaching an agreement with the European Union. These developments — on top of previous deals with Vietnam, the United Kingdom and a framework on rare-earth exports and tech restrictions with China — go a long way toward standing up Trump’s vision for the international economy, with better terms for America. And at least so far, no catastrophic fallout. Heck, the nation looks poised to benefit enormously on several fronts. Trump’s deals in Asia, for starters, reopen US access to cheap markets, sidestepping China, our greatest economic and military rival. Indonesia and the Philippines will pay 19% tariffs on their exports to the United States and levy 0% tariffs on more than 99% of US goods. Japan will see 15% tariffs and invest more than half a trillion dollars into the US economy. Washington will also slap fewer restrictions on Indonesian, Filipino and Japanese goods, everything from cars and clothes to electronics and rubber. And now EU officials are signaling their support for a deal that would mirror the one Trump made with Japan — reciprocal tariffs of 15%. Notably, the EU includes 27 countries in a shared common market, representing the largest singular trading bloc for the United States. The EU deal would clearly benefit US consumers looking to buy, say, French wines or German cars, and also US producers seeking wider access to the European markets. Meanwhile, the resolution of trade issues with so many countries will calm markets and bring confidence and stability to the business community. As for the predicted inflation, it’s nowhere to be seen: June’s consumer price index came in at a reasonable 2.7%. Recall it hit 9% under Joe Biden. That’s partially because corporations, unsure of whether high tariffs will remain permanent and nervous about hiking prices, have absorbed most of the tariffs’ costs, at least for now. More good news: The tariffs brought in $64 billion in revenue for the government in just the first three months since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement. He’s suggested issuing “rebates” based on that haul, but far better to use the new revenue to pay down the runaway national debt. Yes, there’s plenty more to do: Team Trump needs to finalize agreements with Canada, India and Mexico, along with the EU, and numerous smaller countries, before the president’s across-the-board reciprocal tariffs hit Aug. 1. So considerable uncertainty remains. But clearly the signs are good, at least so far — despite all the doomy predictions."

          "content": "Traders seem to agree, at least for now. Futures contracts for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 were up 0.55% this morning prior to the opening bell, after the index closed up 0.68% yesterday. The index is up 18% this year, despite worries that the AI boom bears a resemblance to the dotcom bubble of 2000. Hemant Taneja, CEO of VC firm General Catalyst, was quoted in the Financial Times this morning saying: “Of course there’s a bubble … Bubbles are good. Bubbles align capital and talent in a new trend, and that creates some carnage, but it also creates enduring, new businesses that change the world.” The FT’s report hinges on the fact that VC firms have plowed $161 billion into AI startups this year, and 10 of them—OpenAI and Anthropic among them—now have a collective valuation of $1 trillion. But none of them are profitable, the FT says. We should all stop worrying and learn to love the AI boom, if new research from Goldman Sachs is correct. In a note titled “The AI Spending Boom Is Not Too Big,” Joseph Briggs and his colleagues say, “Anticipated investment levels are sustainable, although the ultimate AI winners remain less clear.” The Goldman team argues that when deployed properly, the productivity gains from AI will far exceed the investment currently going into it. “We are not concerned about the total amount of AI investment. AI investment as a share of U.S. GDP is smaller today (<1%) than in prior large technology cycles (2%-5%). Furthermore, we estimate an $8 trillion present-discounted value for the capital revenue unlocked by AI productivity gains in the U.S., with plausible estimates ranging from $5 trillion–$19 trillion,” they said. The money going into AI-related capital expenditures (capex) will grow massively this year and next, according to Samik Chatterjee and his colleagues at JPMorgan. Capex across the AI “hyperscalers” will grow 60% this year and another 30% next year, they say. “On a dollar basis, the growth implies a significant increase of more than +$100 billion of additional data center capex in 2025, the largest annual step-up to date, surpassing the record set in 2024. Importantly, the stronger trajectory is also anticipated to carry into 2026, where growth is now tracking at … more than +$80 billion for next year.” Capex will be in the region of $300 billion this year from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta alone, Goldman estimates. The irrepressible Daniel Ives of Wedbush, perhaps Wall Street’s biggest cheerleader for AI, took a field trip to Asia to see for himself what the demand for Nvidia’s chips is like. “We estimate the demand to supply ratio from enterprises for Nvidia’s next generation GPUs are approaching 10:1, which is a staggering number, which speaks to how early this AI revolution is in its life cycle,” he told clients in a research note. “We have barely scratched the surface of this fourth industrial revolution."

          "content": "Companies announcing multi-billion dollar investments in artificial intelligence have raised concerns about the formation of a bubble reminiscent of the dotcom boom and bust. Investors are on guard for signals that demand is tailing off or that the massive spending is not paying off as anticipated. A BofA Global Research's monthly fund manager survey revealed that 54% of investors said they thought that AI stocks were in a bubble compared with 38% who do not believe that a bubble exists. Here is a list of industry executives, economists and analysts’ takes on the topic: BANK OF ENGLAND Global markets could tumble if investors' mood sours on the prospects for artificial intelligence, the Bank of England said on October 8. The risk of a sharp market correction has increased, the BoE's Financial Policy Committee said in a quarterly update, in its sharpest warning to date of the dangers of an AI-triggered market slump, adding that the risk of spillovers to Britain's financial system from such a shock was material. BRYAN YEO, GIC PRIVATE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER There's a little bit of a hype bubble going on in the early-stage venture space, said Singapore sovereign wealth fund's Yeo during a panel discussion at the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2025 on October 3. Any company startup with an AI label will be valued right up there at huge multiples of whatever the small revenue (is),... That might be fair for some companies and probably not for others. JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF AMAZON “When people get very excited as they are today about artificial intelligence, for example, every experiment gets funded,... And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas,” Bezos said during the Italian tech week, opens new tab on October 3. “A bubble like a banking bubble, a crisis in the banking system, that's just bad ... The ones that are industrial are not nearly as bad, it could even be good because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, society benefits from those inventions.” JOSEPH BRIGGS, ECONOMIST AT GOLDMAN SACHS' GLOBAL ECONOMICS RESEARCH The flood of multibillion-dollar investments pouring into U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure is sustainable, pushing back on mounting concerns that the sector's spending spree could be overheating, Briggs said in a note on October 16. While the overall macroeconomic case for AI investment remains strong, he cautioned that the ultimate AI winners remain less clear, with fast technological change and low switching costs potentially limiting first-mover advantages. MORTEN WIEROD, ABB CEO I don't think there is a bubble, but we do see do see some constraints in terms of construction capacity not keeping up with all the new investments, Wierod told Reuters on October 16. We are talking about trillions in investment, he said, adding: That will take a few years to implement because there is not enough people and resources to build all this. PIERRE-OLIVIER GOURINCHAS, IMF'S CHIEF ECONOMIST The U.S. artificial intelligence investment boom may be followed by a dot-com-style bust, but it is less likely to be a systemic event that would crater the U.S. or global economy, Gourinchas, said on October 14. This is not financed by debt, and that means that if there is a market correction, some shareholders, some equity holders, may lose out. SAM ALTMAN, OPENAI CEO “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My answer is yes,” Altman told tech media The Verge in August. “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money. We don’t know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money.” UBS Almost as many investors who feel we're in an AI bubble are also hanging on to their investments in the sector, UBS equity strategists said on October 14. Most felt we were in an AI bubble, but that far from the apex of a bubble peak and thus around 90% of the people who said we were in a bubble said they were still invested in many of the AI-related areas."
